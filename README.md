# üßëüèª‚Äçüíª Ingrid Coll (she/her)

**`Solutions & Automation Engineer (Python, SQL, Power Platform) | API Integration Specialist`**

I‚Äôm a Solutions & Automation Engineer with 5+ years of experience and a Master‚Äôs in Software Programming, specializing in developing cloud-based webs and apps with expertise in API integrations, building data pipelines and automating with code. Skilled in Python, SQL, HTML/CSS, JavaScript and low-code Microsoft tools like Power Apps/Automate/BI.

Originally from Barcelona (Spain), I moved to the United States at 18 years old on a college scholarship to challenge myself and pursue professional and personal growth. After graduating, I moved to Austin, fell in love with the city and immersed myself in technology and software development.

I love making things work better. As a natural optimizer and problem solver, I‚Äôm the kind of person that has multiple spreadsheets to manage my personal finances for fun, and keeps a categorized list of recipes on my phone, complete with ingredients, serving sizes, food brands, and macros.

Always open to connect :)

 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Forrest's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my coding journey as a naive computer science student with a passion to learn everything I could about this programming world - code, unix, linux, theory. And all the while, teaching myself iOS development with a dream to build my own app, but that soon got overshadowed by my desire to excel in Java. A desire that landed me a full-stack software engineering job upon graduation. However, I had another desire I had been pursuing throughout this time - YouTube content creation. I eventually ended up quitting my software engineering job to pursue YouTube full-time, and that has been my focus ever since. But there's something that's always bothered me about my journey - abandoning my dream of building my own app to pursue the safe route, a job. Now I've already taken the leap away from that safety net into this uncomfortable, unexplored world that it being a creator. And it worked out, but again, it became comfortable. It's easier to create a video than go out on a ledge and build my own product. I do have to eat, at the end of the day, but I think it's time. It's time to get uncomfortable again. I have a burning desire to get back on the horse, and fulfill that dream younger me had of building my own app, my own product. And in order to do that, I'll be implmementing a few measures to streamline my YouTube content to focus more time on fulfilling that dream - a dream that I'll be ready to tackle in 2023 due to the measure I'm putting in place now until the end of 2022. Don't wait up, because I'm coming.
